# WeGo

Have you ever wanted to go see a movie or check out the latest exhibit at a museum, but you just couldnâ€™t convince any of your friends to come with you? Have you ever found yourself with an extra ticket for a big game or show without a clue where to find someone to join you?

This is a common problem for many people and WeGo is the perfect solution!

WeGo is a social application that allows users to find other users near them who have similar interests, form groups with them, and participate in fun activities together. The goal of the app is to allow our users to meet new people and try new things that they are interested in. Upon signing up, users will be able to fill out additional information about themselves, which can be viewed by other users when deciding to do an activity together. Users can create new activities, look through existing activities posted by other users, and request to join activities with other users. Users must be approved before being able to attend an activity.

## Splash Page

Users will land on this page which shows upcoming activities sorted by date and popular activities sorted byy the number of participants. Users can swipe through these activities and quickly determine whether or not they would like to join. In addition, users will be able to search for activities by activity title from this page.
